            <p><b>IT Professional: Mrs. Nguyễn Xuân Thi</b></p>
<br>
<p>Mrs. Thi Nguyen is a User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) designer, currently working at KMS Technologies. Coming from a background in Development and Web Design, she has worked for more than 15 years in the industry, having contributed to making these products more enjoyable to use: </p>

<p>Mrs. Thi Nguyen is a User Interface and User Experience (UI<i>UX) Designer. Her job is to make websites</i>apps/products that are both visually beautiful, stylish, on-brand, and functionally intuitive, easy-to-use. If you’ve ever loved and trusted a product because of how it always gets the job done quickly and stylishly, never making you pause and question, then a team of UIUX designers somewhere has done a very good job. </p>
<br>
<p>In their goal of making lovable products, UIUX designers like Mrs. Thi has to handle a variety of responsibilities, which she summarized as:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><b>Research:</b> finding and understanding the target demographic that they are building for. By asking questions and doing surveys, etc. designers can learn the scale, culture, process… of the demographic. Using this knowledge, they can figure out workflows, pain points, and users’ goals to inform themselves and build functional products.
</li><li><b>Content strategy:</b> the planning, creation, delivery, and management of content to get the right one to the right user at the right time. Designers focus on correctly using not just writing but also images, videos… to create a cohesive, engaging, and meaningful experience for users.
</li><li><b>Information Architecture:</b> the structure & layout of content planned above. UX designers have to consider how information should be grouped, which to prioritize and which to hide… to let users effortlessly find what they’re looking for.
</li><li><b>Interaction design:</b> the design of the interaction between users and products. Using the right components (such as buttons, text fields, checkboxes, toggles…), color, size, spacing, and feedbacks, designers can clues users in and let them intuitively understand how the product work.
</li><li><b>Visual Design:</b> how the product looks, brings the interfaces to life from an aesthetic / brand / creative perspective. Designers have to consider a vast range of choices: color, shapes, spacing, images, contexts, typography… to be beautiful and speaks the brand’s values.
</li><li><b>Usability Testing:</b> armed with the knowledge of their research and understanding of their work, designers are essential in the testing process. During this phase, designers can test and learn about shortcomings are in their designs, and improve upon it.
</li></ol>
<br>
<p>These steps done well brings a variety of benefits to the product, and is the ultimate goal of a UIUX designer:</p>
<ul><li>	More frequent visits and re-visits for a longer duration on the products, therefore increasing sales. 
</li><li>	Decease user errors, which in turn decrease customers support costs and word of mouth complains, bettering the image of the brand.
</li><li>	Helps in attract and acquire new users.
</li><li>	Speaks and showcase the brand’s style, message, goals, and values to its users.
</li><li>	As the final result of all other benefits is instilling trust in the products and the brand, which is the most important factor.
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>As you can see, UI<i>UX is a multi-disciplinary field that requires the designer to be both logical, realistic, and creative, artistic. Done well, UI</i>UX could be the factor that pushes the products ahead of the competition. </p>

<p>As the middle part of the process, UIUX designers will collaborate with (nearly) all departments in the making a product. Communication is essential, as well as having an open mind and the ability to see from other’s perspective, according to Mrs. Thi, since to be good a UIUX designer, you must be able to understand clearly and get your ideas across a wide range of people, below are the few most important ones:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Developers:</b> being the department that brings the designs to life through coding, developers are essential (people) in the network of designers. This back-and-forth relationship informs both sides of how the products will work and therefore how to build it. Mrs. Thi is no strangers to conflicts that might arise here, but she stresses that it is important for the designers to be empathetic and understand the problem from the dev’s perspective.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Other designers:</b> as with every team, designers must be able to communicate effectively and respectfully with other team members to get ideas and concepts across. Mrs. Thi advises careful consideration to be able to communicate with people with different work habits, skill levels, etc. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Quality Assurance testers</b>: testing is one of the responsibilities of the designers, and they will work with the QA / QC team regularly. Designers must be able to understand, receive constructive criticism, and extract useful feedback from this team objectively and not take anything personally.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Product Owner:</b> this is the person who will give the designers requirements and features to be built. Designers must have and utilize extensively their knowledge to understand these requests, anticipate how it will play out in the future, clarify unclear aspects, and even object unfeasible ideas.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Public / Client:</b> the people which the product aims to satisfy. Regardless of how many there are, designers must be able to pose questions and gather insights from this group. The better they are as research, empathizing, and understanding this group, the better the final product can be. This is one of the hardest and most time-consuming phases of the process, according to Mrs. Thi.</p>

<h2 id="Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?">Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?</h2>
<p>According to Mrs. Thi, the most time-consuming task in a UIUX designer’s work is planning, designing, and anticipating the master design system, which is a series of components (such as buttons, toggles, fields…) that can be reused in different combinations.</p>
<br>
<p>Although they are time-consuming, the design system is essential in ensuring the product will be successful in the long run. By allowing the reuse of components, design system let designers and developers:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Save time
</li><li>Build a consistent product that looks and feels similar across multiple platforms
</li><li>Scale the product efficiently
</li><li>Instill trust in the user, which is one of the most important goals of UIUX.
</li></ol>
<br>
<p>This is the most time-consuming aspect of Mrs. Thi’s work. According to her, designing just the first 4-5 pages of the design system for large products can take up to one whole month. For smaller products, this process usually around a week or two. The reason that it takes so long is that there are many aspects to consider:</p>
<ul><li>	<b>Scale:</b> the system must work from a small, medium, and large scale. To save costs on re-working, the system must support a wide range of variables: language (how will it look with different languages?), content (will extremely long content mess with the layout?), platform (how will it look on desktop, mobile?), amongst many other.
</li><li>	<b>Anticipation:</b> even while designing the first few pages, Mrs. Thi must have already planned out how it will look and work 100s of pages into the future. Any mistakes made in the foundation of the system might be unforeseeable, incredibly time-consuming, and costly to fix in the future. Anticipating and foreseeing these shortcomings takes a lot of careful consideration, experience, and knowledge.
</li><li>	<b>Uniqueness:</b> more than just being functional, the system must be on-brand, beautiful, and delightful enough to “wow” users. From colors, shape, animation… every aspect of the interface must speak the unique value of the brand. 
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>As for the physical location where she spends most of her time, Mrs. Thi is currently spending most of her time at KMS Technologies, where she is currently building a design system and using her knowledge to make products such as (something). In her opinion, KMS is one of the few rare Vietnamese companies capable of delivering products on a global scale.</p>

<h2 id="What aspect of their position is most challenging?">What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
<p>Designing a product that is meet all the requirements of a great UIUX: consistent, functional, scalable, beautiful is already difficult enough. Perfecting these aspects requires countless hours of research and hard work from the designer. However, with knowledge, this is achievable. Something far more challenging, and infinitely more elusive, is adding the “wow” factor. This is the ingredient that can differentiate and propel the product above and beyond the competition.</p>
<br>
<p>Looking back on her decade-plus experience in the field, Mrs. Thi asserts that finding and implementing this “wow” factor has been one of the most challenging aspects of her work. Many hours of careful research must be done to figure out the colors, movements, shapes… that not only embodies the brand but offer a unique and delightful experience to its users. Then, must then be thoughtfully implemented in all the right nooks-and-crannies of the design. </p>
