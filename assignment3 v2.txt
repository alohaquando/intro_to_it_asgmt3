2. Motivation
In many cases, people are having difficulties in starting a workout and keeping it. In Tae Sung’s case, he actually started workout 1 years ago, but he didn’t get much improvement in his body because he was doing it efficiently. Also, for Quan’s, he felt stressed and pushed when he was doing workout so he quitted it for a long time. We think the biggest reasons are there are some difficulties in getting information and not much data that is kind for beginners. So, we want to make an application that is suitable for beginners. Also, because of a sedentary lifestyle, most workers are having a lack of motivation. It causes many diseases like obesity. To deal with it, they just need exercises. However, our group thinks most workout applications can’t solve these problems. This is why our application is important for people.
